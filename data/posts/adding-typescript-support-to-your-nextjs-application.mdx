## Why Typescript

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a strongly typed programming language which builds on JavaScript
giving you better tooling at any scale. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are
also valid TypeScript programs.

## Ease of Use

One of the big benefits of TypeScript is that it enables IDE's to provide a richer environment for spotting common errors
as you type the code.

For a large JavaScript project, adopting TypeScript might result in more robust software, while still being deployable where
a regular JavaScript application would run.

It is open source, and you get the clever intellisense as you type if you use a supported IDE like Microsoft's
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

NextJS provides an integrated TypeScript experience out of the box which makes our life's much easier.

## Installation

Let's begin by opening your Terminal and running the following command

```bash
npx create-next-app next-typescript-example && cd next-typescript-example
```

this will create a new NextJS project directory named `next-typescript-example` and change to that directory.

Create a new `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your directory.

```bash
touch tsconfig.json
```

Now, try restarting the developement server (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`). It
should spit out some warnings like so.

```bash
# It looks like you're trying to use TypeScript but do not have the required
# package(s) installed.

# Please install typescript, @types/react, and @types/node by running:

# yarn add --dev typescript @types/react @types/node

```

this is because we have not installed TypeScript or its accompnying types for our project, so lets
go ahead and install them.

```bash
# If you're using npm
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node

# If you're using yarn
yarn add --dev typescript @types/react @types/node
```

Now restart the development server again, NextJS will automaticall populate the `tsconfig.json` file and have created the `next-env.d.ts`
files, try not to change anything within this file, now you've added Typescript to your NextJS app.

Now let's rename the files to `ts` and `tsx` files, a `.tsx` files is a TypeScript file written using JSX syntax.
Try to be consistent with naming of the files in your project although a `.ts` file may export a TSX Component it is not
considered as a good convention to do so and might create confusions with your collegues when you are working in a major Project.

```bash
pages/api/*.js      --> pages/api/*.ts
pages/_app.js       --> pages/_app.tsx
pages/index.js      --> pages/index.tsx
pages/_document.js  --> pages/_document.tsx
```

with that done go to your `pages/_app.ts` file and use the built-in type `AppProps`, like so:

```TypeScript
import { AppProps } from 'next/app'

function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default App
```

with that we've converted our JavaScript NextJS app to a TypeScript one. here are some most commonly used NextJS specific types
that you will run into.

** Data Fetching Methods **

`getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths`, `getServerSideProps` types:

```TypeScript
import { GetStaticProps, GetStaticPaths, GetServerSideProps } from 'next'

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async context => {
  // ...
}

export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
  // ...
}

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async context => {
  // ...
}

```

** API Routes **

`Request`, `Response` types:

```TypeScript
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'

export default (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  // ...
}
```

That's it! Your app is now powered by Typescript. you can learn more about using NextJS in TypesScript by referring to NextJS official [TypeScript documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript).
