## Why Preact?

[Preact](https://preactjs.com/) is a lightweight altrenative to React that focuses on perfomance. It houses an extensive compatibility layer with React to make
sure your existing React code can be used in Preact. It's called *preact/compat* according to Preact's website it's bundle size is 3kB which is pretty
low compared to the minified bundle of *react + react-dom* size of 128kB. If you care about squeezing out every last bit of perfomance for your project then
Preact's the way to go, they prioritize perfomance and is one of the key feature's of Preact also Preact has no dependency.

## Ease of Use

Replacing React with Preact in your project is pretty easy we are going to leverage *Webpack's* alias to do it.

The process is pretty simple. First, we install preact and preact/compat with those dependencie's installed, we will configure
webpack to alias React imports so they point to Preact instead.

## Installation

Let's start with installing our Preact dependencie's

<CodeBlock>
```bash:Terminal
# If you're using npm
npm install preact

# If you're using yarn
yarn add preact
````
</CodeBlock>

now that we have our dependencies installed let's configure our *next.config.js* file to set alias for React, we are going to use Preact only on the Production Build.

<CodeBlock>
```JavaScript:next.config.js
module.exports = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  images: {
    domains: [],
  },
  webpack: (config, { dev, isServer }) => {
    // Replace React with Preact in production build
    if (!dev && !isServer) {
      Object.assign(config.resolve.alias, {
        react: "preact/compat",
        "react-dom/test-utils": "preact/test-utils",
        "react-dom": "preact/compat",
      });
    }
    return config;
  },
};
````
</CodeBlock>

Now that our *next.config.js* file is properly configured let's just build our project to see the result's.

<CodeBlock>
```bash:Terminal
#If you're using yarn
yarn build

#If you're using npm
npm run build
```
</CodeBlock>

Here's the build output for *LEARNNEXT's* build output with and without Preact.

Notice the considerable difference in First Load JS size, this won't be perceivable in modern network connection's and
devices but will considerably decrease the first load time for users that might be using 3G networks and congested network connections
which inturn improve your applications user experience.

This was a detailed walkthrough of using Preact in your NextJS application instead of React, If you would like to know more about [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) and it's advantage's over React, I highly recommend reading their [Getting Started Page](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/getting-started).
